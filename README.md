# Batch Folder Renamer

A simple batch folder renaming tool with a minimal GUI built using CustomTkinter (CTk).  
It allows you to:

- Select a target directory.
- Automatically remove predefined prefixes.
- Clean up suffixes (e.g., TV series season numbers).
- Format folder names by removing extra spaces and dots.

### Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Select the directory containing the folders to rename.
3. Click **Start** to process and clean folder names.
