## 📥 Download

You can download the latest compiled `.exe` version from the [Releases](https://github.com/TitanComputer/Batch-Folder-Renamer/releases/latest) section.  
No need to install Python — just download and run.

## ⚙️ Usage

If you're using the Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```
Or, run the Batch-Folder-Renamer.exe file directly if you downloaded the compiled version.

### 🖥️ How to Use the GUI

## How to Use

1. **Select a Folder**  
   - Click the **Browse** button and choose the main folder that contains your subfolders.

2. **Configure Prefixes**  
   - In the **Prefix Box**, add the text lines you want the program to remove from the beginning of each folder name.  
   - Example:  
     ```

3. **Start the Process**  
   - Click the **Start Process** button.  
   - The program will:
     - Remove any defined prefixes.  
     - Remove suffixes starting from `S01`, `s01`, etc. (season markers).  
     - Trim extra characters from the start and end of names.  
     - Replace dots (`.`), underscores (`_`), or dashes (`-`) with spaces.  
     - Capitalize each word (Title Case).
